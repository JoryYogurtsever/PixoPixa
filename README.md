# pixopixa

> Interactive Gifts and Ads

# Technical Description

> This site does use a vue router and components, but as of yet there is not much complicated javascript
In the future I will include a contact us form as well as an HTML canvas that can hopefully be use to
draw, save and download images, but these projects are still ongoing.

# General Description

> This site is mostly intended to provide information readily for people who are interested in our
custom video game company. PixoPixa will create a simple platformer video game starring you or a
loved one and customize many areas of game play based on your preferences.
