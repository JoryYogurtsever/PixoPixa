      My name is Jory, and I am from Canada. This PixoPixa project started as a birthday
      gift for my girlfriend. I can't even guess how many hours I spent figuring this all
      out. At the end of all that she says to me, "You should turn this into a buisness!"
      Well here we are. If you want a fun, original, personal gift to give your friend or loved-one,
      (or if you just want one for yourself), PixoPixa will take the
      learning-several-programs-and-the-nuances-of-the-video-game-industry
      portion out of the project. Just give
      us a bit of information on how you'd like it personalized and we will do the rest. We are
      a remote based company, but you can reach us through email at admin@pixopixa.com. Or you
      can visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PixoPixaGames">facebook page</a>
      and send us an IM with any questions. Thanks for your interest
      in PixoPixa, have a great day!
