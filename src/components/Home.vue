    Pixo? Pixa?

    Imagine a video game starring you! Jumping across platforms,
    trees and enemies' heads to try and achieve whatever
    your goal is in life, or just whatever goofy goal you have
    in the game. You can collect whatever you like along
    the way and even play your favorite music in the background.
    I've found you don't need to be a video game enthusiast
    to fall in love with your PixoPixa game, it's a great little
    kick of nostalgia from many of our childhoods
    and just an all round great experience to see yourself
    starring in an interactive game. take a look at our <a

    to get a sense of what our products are like and maybe
    start brainstorming a couple ideas, then head over to the
